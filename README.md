# game-marcet

This is a retro game marcet app I made at a cross platform development course in 2022. The app was made in Vue.js with Directus as backend and was tested in an iPhone emulator on my personal computer before I turned in the exam.

# The app is not finished

There is some functionality that the app is missing and the design is far from perfect. Directus have removed their free community version, and therefore made it too expensive for me to finish the app, so I chose to leave it as it is. I did not have time to finish it the app while making it. We had some other exams ongoing in the same period as this one. I had plans to finish it some time this semester (Spring 2023) but since I don't have access to Directus I chose not to.
